      <h1>Welcome to Ohlone Sky</h1>
      <p>Ohlone Sky is a visionary aerial gondola project connecting San Francisco to Treasure Island. Explore the future of urban mobility—quiet, efficient, and panoramic.</p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What is Ohlone Sky?</strong> Ohlone Sky is a proposed network of gondolas (aerial cable cars) around the San Francisco Bay Area, including routes from San Francisco to Treasure Island, the Dumbarton Rail Corridor (Fremont to Redwood City), and between Diridon Station and the San José Airport.</li>
        <li><strong>What is a gondola or aerial cable car?</strong> It's a cabin propelled by a cable strung between stations, commonly seen at ski resorts. Capacities range from 4-15 people for gondolas to 80-100 for aerial tramways.</li>
        <li><strong>How fast are aerial trams?</strong> Modern 3S gondola lifts can travel up to 19 mph, making the San Francisco to Treasure Island journey approximately seven minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Where are the proposed stations?</strong> San Francisco: Pier 24, Yerba Buena Island, and Treasure Island. Dumbarton Rail Corridor: Redwood City, Middlefield Road (Menlo Park), Willow Road (Menlo Park), Dumbarton Circle (Fremont), Ardenwood Regional Preserve, Fremont Centerville, and BART Fremont Station. San José: Diridon Station and San José Mineta International Airport.</li>
        <li><strong>How often will it run?</strong> Depending on demand, departures could be every thirty seconds from dawn to dusk or shorter during high demand periods.</li>
        <li><strong>Why San Francisco?</strong> With 20,000 housing units planned for Treasure Island, Ohlone Sky offers a carbon-neutral transit solution, reducing Bay Bridge traffic and providing greater frequency than current ferry services.</li>
        <li><strong>Why the Dumbarton Rail Corridor?</strong> Addressing the transit gap between Menlo Park and Fremont, Ohlone Sky offers a reliable, scenic journey with greater frequency than existing options.</li>
        <li><strong>Why San José?</strong> San José has been seeking bids to connect Diridon Station to the airport; Ohlone Sky offers a cost-effective and expedient solution.</li>
        <li><strong>What about the wind?</strong> Advanced 3S gondolas can operate in winds up to 68 mph; the system would shut down before reaching these speeds to prevent motion sickness.</li>
        <li><strong>Is this a public transport solution, tourist attraction, or both?</strong> It's both—a clean, environmentally friendly, and seamless way to get around the Bay Area.</li>
        <li><strong>How much will Ohlone Sky cost to build?</strong> Costs vary, but similar projects, like Paris's 4.5-kilometer-long cable car, are estimated at €132 million (~$145 million).</li>
        <li><strong>How fast can this be constructed?</strong> Each route could be completed within five years once funded and permits are secured.</li>
        <li><strong>How far is the Ferry Building to Pier 24?</strong> Approximately half a mile (800 meters), about a ten-minute walk.</li>
      </ul>
