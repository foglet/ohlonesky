<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Ohlone Sky</h2> <p><em>What is Ohlone Sky?</em> Ohlone Sky (working title) is a proposed network of gondolas (aerial cable cars) to connect Pier 24 along the Embarcadero to Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island. One of our goals is to become the de facto option for those traveling between Treasure Island, Yerba Buena and the San Francisco waterfront. </p><br />

<p><em>Is Ohlone Sky a private project?</em> Ohlone Sky will be built through a public-private partnership and operated by a Public Benefit Corporation (B Corp), modeled after successful projects like the Roosevelt Island Tramway.</p><br />
        
<p><em>What is an gondola or aerial cable car?</em> A gondola or aerial cable car is a cabin propelled by a cable stretched between two or more stations and towers. Common types include enclosed cabins and open-air ski lifts found at resorts. A gondola cabin can transport as many as thirty-eight people. An aerial tramway 80-100.</p> <br />

<p><em>How long is the journey?</em> The journey from Pier 24 to Treasure Island takes approximately twelve minutes.</p><br />

<p><em>Where are the proposed stations? </em>Proposed stations are located near Pier 24, Yerba Buena Island, and Treasure Island.</p><br>

<p><em>How often will it run?</em> Departures are scheduled every 20–30 seconds from dawn to dusk, ensuring high-frequency service.
</p><br>

<p><em>Where are the nearest transit connections?</em> The Pier 24 terminus is within minutes of the F Line, Muni Metro, Muni buses, BART, cable cars, and the San Francisco Ferry Building and terminal.</p><br>        

<p><em>Why here? </em>Currently, 20,000 housing units are under construction on Treasure Island, with several condos already built on Yerba Buena Island. Ohlone Sky addresses future transit needs for residents and visitors, providing an alternative to driving. To be clear, this is meant as a supplement to urban transportation. We want to add to, not detract from, mobility options.</p><br />
             
<p><em>What about wind on the bay?</em> Ohlone Sky may temporarily close due to high winds on the bay—not due to safety concerns, but to prevent passenger discomfort from motion sickness. </p><br />
            
<p><em>Who is this for?</em> Ohlone Sky is designed for anyone traveling between Treasure Island, Yerba Buena Island, and San Francisco—whether attending a Bay FC match, visiting Panorama Park, exploring a craft fair, or meeting friends for champagne and oysters. It is poised to become one of San Francisco's most frequented tourist attractions.

<p><em>How much will Ohlone Sky cost to build? </em> The estimated construction cost for Ohlone Sky is approximately $275 million. For comparison, Paris, France, is constructing a 4.5-kilometer-long cable car (<a href="https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/le-reseau/projets/cablec1">Câble C1</a>) with five stations for €132 million (~$145 million), scheduled for completion in 2025. The San Francisco route spans the same length but requires two towers in the bay contributing to the overall estimate. Ohlone Sky will be privately funded and sponsored.</p><br />

<p><em>How fast can this be constructed? </em> Ohlone Sky could be completed within five years after permits have been secured and funded. Ropeways and cabins are standarized and can be employed quickly though once EIRs and approvals have been secured. Building into the bay is not a timely affair. The build out, not including the towers the bay, could be a brief ten months.</p><br />

<p><em>How long can a ropeway or cableway be?</em> According to the Doppelmayr Group, "800-1500 metres for a tricable installation" like Ohlone Sky. The distance between Pier 24 and Yerba Buena Island is two miles (3200 metres). The two-tower approach easily lands within this range. </p><br />
    
<p><em>What's the fare? </em> $10 roundtrip is our goal. It will be accessible via Clipper and mobile payment options. </p><br />

<p><em>Bikes and scooters? </em> Bikes, e-bikes and e-scooters are welcome. All cabins are ADA-accessible. We are the first-last mile in your bike ride across the bay. Note: This is in the route of the Bay Trail.</p><br />

<p><em>How far is the Ferry Building to Pier 24?</em> It's approximately one-half mile (800 metres); a moderate ten-minute walk. Being one of the most frequented places in the City we expect many visitors.</p><br />

    <p><em>What is the current state of rail in the the Bay Area? </em> <a href=" http://calurbanist.com">CalUrbanist.com</a>, by Steve Boland,  publishes a comprehensive map of current <a href="http://calurbanist.com/bay-area-rail/">Bay Area Rail systems</a>.</p><br />

<p><em>What are some examples of gondolas and aerial trams? </em> Locally, Oakland has the super cool <a href="https://www.oaklandzoo.org/blog/gondola">Oakland Zoo Gondola</a> which sports a six-county bird's-eye view over live oak trees, elephants, camels, and bison. San Francisco sports a little-used gondola to Salesforce Park (atop the Salesforce Transit Center) from the street-level plaza on Mission Street. In Napa, <a href="https://www.sterlingvineyards.com/en/blog/sterling-aerial-gondola-facts.html">Sterling Vineyards</a> 
     lays claim to "the only winery in the world with a aerial gondola." In Oregon, the 
        <a href="http://www.gobytram.com">Portland Aerial Tram</a> connects South Waterfront to Marquam Hill with 10,000 daily riders. In Colorado, the 
        <a href="https://www.telluride.com/plan/our-destination/telluride-mountain-village-gondola/">Telluride Village Gondola</a> "offers free, seasonal transportation for the public." Some consider it the most beautiful commute in the United States. For now. In New York, the <a href="https://rioc.ny.gov/302/Tram">Roosevelt Island Tramway</a> connects the Upper East Side in Manhattan to Roosevelt Island. It was the first commuter aerial tramway in North America, opening in 1976.</p><br />

         <p><em>When can I ride this?</em> We can't ride this yet but we can certainly share our enthusiasm and with local, state, and federal officials and other interested parties to get this built. Our estimate is late 2030.</p><br />
