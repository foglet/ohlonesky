<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Ohlone Sky</h2> <p><em>What is Ohlone Sky?</em> Ohlone Sky (working title) is a proposed network of gondolas (aerial cable cars) from Pier 24 along the Embarcsadero to Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island. It could be built quickly and would provide much benefit — essentially becoming the transit center for Treasure Island serving residents. Potentially, it will become one the most frequented attractions in our fair city. </p><br />

<p><em>What is an gondola or aerial cable car?</em> A gondola or aerial cable car is literally a "car" (cabin) propelled by a cable strung between two or more stations. Some of the most common types of gondolas are enclosed cabins or simply open-air ski lifts at ski resorts. A gondola cabin can transport as many as thirty-eight people. An aerial tramway 80-100.</p> <br />

<p><em>What's the journey time?</em> State-of-the-art 3S gondola lifts by Doppelmayr can travel up to 8.5 m/s or 19 mph. The San Francisco to Treasure Island journey is a mere twelve minutes at top speed.</p><br />

<p><em>Where are the proposed stations? </em> The are three stations: Pier 24, Yerba Buena, and Treasure Island.</p><br> 
            
<p><em>How often will it run?</em> Departures could be every 15-30 seconds dawn to dusk. Frequency equals freedom.</p><br>

<p><em>Where is the nearest transit</em> Ohlone Sky at Pier 24 is within mere minutes of Muni Metro, Muni and BART, and the San Francisco Ferry terminal.</p><br>        


<p><em>Why here?</em> Currently, developers are building 20,000 units of housing on Treasure Island. A small number of condos have also been build on Yerba Buena Island already. This is the carbon-neutral transit solution to driving on the Bay Bridge. Its frequency cannot be equaled by any other form of transit. We love the ferry but need greater capacity. The journey is the destination. </p><br />

<p><em>What about the temporary disruption due to weather?</em> Ohlone Sky may temporarily close due to threat or lightning and thunder and very strong winds. The most advanced Doppelmayr/Garaventa 3S gondolas tolerate winds to 68 mph (110 kmh). </p><br />
            
<p><em>Who is this for?</em> This system is for residents and tourists travelling between Treasure Island, Yerba Island, and San Francisco: soccer, concerts, a craftfair, to meetup with friends. It's a clean, enviromentally friendly, qne carbon neutral.</p><br />

<p><em>How much will Ohlone Sky cost to build? </em> Globally, these run about $7 million per mile. However, station size and design wildly inflate the cost. Currently, Paris, France is building at 4.5-kilometer-long cable car <a href="https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/le-reseau/projets/cablec1">(“Câble C1“) </a>for €132 million (~ $145 million) with five stations to be completed in 2025. The San Francisco route, roughly the same, necessitates two towers into the bay at $60 million per propelling the estimate towards $275 million. </p><br />

<p><em>How fast can this be constructed? </em> Any one of these routes could be completed within five years when funded and permits secured. London, England built the two-station IFS Cloud Cable Car (originally Emirates Air Line) in ten months for the 2012 Olympics. There are more the 15,000 ropeways and people move systems worldwide. Thus, the ropeways and cabins are standarized and can be employed quickly. Stations design and permiting quickly consume the timeline.</p><br />

<p><em>How long can a ropeway or cableway be?</em> According to the Doppelmayr Group, "typically, there is a distance of 150 to 300 metres between towers for a monocable installation and 800 – 1500 metres for a tricable installation." The distance between Pier 24 and Yerba Buena Island is two miles (3200 metres). The two tower approach lands at 1066 metres. </p><br />
    
<p><em>How much will it cost to ride Ohlone Sky? </em> The price has not been set. $10 roundtrip is our goal. It will be accessible via Clipper and mobile payment options. </p><br />

<p><em>How far is the Ferry Building to Pier 24?</em> It's approximately one-half mile or 800 meters; a moderate ten-minute walk. The Ferry Building is one of the most visited places in San Francisco. We expect more than a handful of those visitors to ride Ohlone Sky.</p><br />

    <p><em>What is the current state of rail in the the Bay Area? </em> <a href=" http://calurbanist.com">CalUrbanist.com</a>, by Steve Boland,  publishes a comprehensive map of current <a href="http://calurbanist.com/bay-area-rail/">Bay Area Rail systems</a>.</p><br />

<p><em>What are some examples of gondolas and aerial trams? </em> Locally, Oakland has the super cool <a href="https://www.oaklandzoo.org/blog/gondola">Oakland Zoo Gondola</a> which sports a six-county bird's-eye view over live oak trees, elephants, camels, and bison. San Francisco sports a little-used gondola to Salesforce Park (atop the Salesforce Transit Center) from the street-level plaza on Mission Street. In Napa, <a href="https://www.sterlingvineyards.com/en/blog/sterling-aerial-gondola-facts.html">Sterling Vineyards</a> 
     lays claim to "the only winery in the world with a aerial gondola." In Oregon, the 
        <a href="http://www.gobytram.com">Portland Aerial Tram</a> connects South Waterfront to Marquam Hill with 10,000 daily riders. In Colorado, the 
        <a href="https://www.telluride.com/plan/our-destination/telluride-mountain-village-gondola/">Telluride Village Gondola</a> "offers free, seasonal transportation for the public." Some consider it the most beautiful commute in the United States. For now. In New York, the <a href="https://rioc.ny.gov/302/Tram">Roosevelt Island Tramway</a> connects the Upper East Side in Manhattan to Roosevelt Island. It was the first commuter aerial tramway in North America, opening in 1976.</p><br />

         <p><em>When can I ride this?</em> We can't ride this yet but we can certainly share our enthusiasm and with local, state, and federal officials and other interested parties to get this built.</p><br />
