            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brandDark mb-0">No Traffic</h2>
            <p>
              No cars. No sideshows. No congestion. Just smooth, reliable, flowing above the Bay—with poetry, purpose, and promise. For cyclists, it's the first-and-last-mile link. For everyone, it’s freedom to move. And just twelve minutes end to end.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brandDark mb-0">Carbon Neutral. Sustainable</h2>
            <p>
              Ohlone Sky is fully electric and emission-free, helping San Francisco meet its climate commitments with minimal energy use and a compact, near-silent design. Transiting congestion, it reduces greenhouse gases as the island grows and supports resilient infrastructure, equitable mobility, and sustainable development—lifting communities and setting an example for cities everywhere. It’s not just for San Francisco, but for the world we want to live in.
            </p>

          <!-- Connecting Communities -->
          <div>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brandDark mb-0">Connecting Communities</h2>
            <p>
              Operating every day, Ohlone Sky links Treasure Island directly to the heart of the city—generating tax revenue, creating jobs, and delivering public benefit. With each ride, a car-free trip to and from the island is possible and preferable.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Extraordinary Views -->
          <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brandDark mb-0">Extraordinary Views</h2>
          <p>
            As the City’s newest innovation, Ohlone Sky is more than transit—it’s a soaring journey. Cradled above the Bay, we move through light and air, as fog curls in from the Pacific and the water shimmers below. It frames one of the most breathtaking urban panoramas on Earth. Like La Paz, London, Mexico City and Portland, Ohlone Sky will become a new icon on the Bay—a silver thread weaving together our past, present, and future.
          </p>
        </div>

          <!-- A Commitment to Giving -->

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brandDark mb-0">A Commitment to Giving</h2>
            <p>
              Ohlone Sky sets aside 10% of its annual revenue to nourish what moves us most: the communities we live in, the climate we share, and the cultures that shape us. As a certified B Corp, we see transit not just as a path from here to there, but as a line of connection that binds purpose to place. As movement with meaning, Ohlone Sky advances society forward.
